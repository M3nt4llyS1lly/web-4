<p tabindex="0">If you didn't know, a long time ago way before Naawi-Oodena was created, this land was previously known as Kaypong Barracks.</p>
<p tabindex="0">The Kaypong Barracks was a military base that was built during the 1940s or WWII on treaty 1 land which originally belonged 
    to the First Nation People, it was mainly used for military training and housing canadian soldiers. The Kapyong Barracks 
    were shut down during 2004 due to not being needed anymore.</p>
<p tabindex="0">The legal battle for First Nation's people to reclaim the land that belonged to them took 15 years but at the end of the day</p>
